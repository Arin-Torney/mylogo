# mylogo
Hello Everyone, this is Arin Torney! I have developed a **small application similar to MSWLogo** for turtle graphics using Python. If you know MSWLogo, you will find easy to use it.

Example:
<pre>
>>> fd
>>> fd 90
>>> rt
>>> rt 90
</pre>

<em>P.S. You will need to have Python installed to run it.</em>
